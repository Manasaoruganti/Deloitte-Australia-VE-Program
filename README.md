**Task - 1: Build a dashboard to explore the client's telemetry data.**
The task involves analyzing telemetry data using Tableau software. To complete the task, download and install Tableau, import the provided daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip file, and create calculated measures for unhealthy statuses. Create bar charts for downtime per factory and downtime per device type. Then, create a dashboard with these charts, set the first chart as a filter, and select the factory with the highest downtime. Take a screenshot of the dashboard and submit it as the task completed. A step-by-step Task Guide PDF is available for assistance.
**Task - 2: Help your team to complete an investigation into unfair pay.**
The final task involves editing an Excel file called "Equality Table.xlsx" that contains three columns: Factory, Job Role, and Equality Score. The objective is to create a fourth column called "Equality class" to classify the equality scores into three types: Fair (within the range of +-10), Unfair (less than -10 and greater than +10), and Highly Discriminative (less than -20 and greater than +20). Examples of the classification are provided. After completing the task, upload the edited version of the file.
